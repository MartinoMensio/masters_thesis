    \toprule
    \textbf{feature} & \textbf{Keras} & \textbf{Tensorflow} \\
    \midrule
    Abstraction level & High & Can go down to reach single operations, but also high level API is provided by lots of classes \\
    \midrule
    Learning difficulty & Quite easy & More difficult, lots of details to consider \\
    \midrule
    Support for complex operations & Focuses more on simple regular layers and cells & Lot of already defined classes, and also helpers function that can help building complex operations \\
    \midrule
    Best for & Rapid prototyping & Advanced operations \\
    \midrule
    Documentation & Documentation good for what is implemented & Documentation gap between trivial and advanced \\
