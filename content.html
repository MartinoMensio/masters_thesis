   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     autonomous system should be designed in a way to make clear that is not a human
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     should identify as autonomous system at the start of new interactions
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Cases:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Self-driving car: should be recognizable in order to avoid accidents and to allow other drivers (autonomous or not) to behave in proper way
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Virtual assistants: pretending to be human is a dangerous precedent. Now it is clear that they are AI, but with technological progress the difference could become unnoticed
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Online games: bots can have some advantages and disadvantages, but user should know what kind of player they belong to

   <span>
    “The rise of social bots”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Problem: social bots can be harmful. Beyond the problem of veracity of information, they can gain influence and become popular
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Cases:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Political influence: audience is artificially enlarged
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Market influence: fake informations are amplified without fact-checking
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Exposing private informations: this makes people not to trust social media
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Manipulate emotions: on socials, they are contagious
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: detect bots
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Auto-reposting: easy to spot with posts/tweets without sense
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     More advanced bots: emulating human behavior, filling profiles with data that seems legit, interacting actively with other users. In some cases they also clone profiles of real users
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Implementation types:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Based on social media information (graph-based): “sybil” accounts are prone to have more connections with other sybils -&gt; groups. Based on assumption that legitimate users refuse to interact with unknown accounts, but this is not so true
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Based on crowdsourcing: humans analyze profiles to detect bots, and majority voting is applied (same profiles shown to different workers)
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Machine-learning: find features that are significant for discrimination. The system analyzes a set of features (network, user, friends, timing, content, sentiment) to evaluate a score using cross validation. Not able to detect cyborgs (mixture of human and bot) and hacked accounts

    “Is that a bot running the social media feed?”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: understand if users perceive differently a bot agent or a human agent
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Results: bots are perceived credible, attractive and competent as humans. The cause is that users use the same way of interacting with bots and with humans. However the attraction to the human agent is higher
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Limitation: very restricted context

     Proposition: analyze the impact of autonomous systems on society, how they are perceived

   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Problems of autonomous system:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Humans want to always have control and power. The system’s autonomy should always be bounded: only automatically perform specific tasks as requested. However in some cases there can be conflicts between what the user asks and the principle the system was designed with. This should be the only situation in which the system must disregard a command. If the system decides things on his own, also without conflicting with commands, this is seen as a threat to human superiority on machines. The hierarchy of society is threatened
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Realistic threats: menacing safety, wellbeing or material resources
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Symbolic threats: maintain the difference between human and machine. The concept of identity and distinctiveness are threatened
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Both kinds of threat lead to negative attitudes towards robots and robotics research

    Guidelines

  </h3>
  <p>
   <span>
    Define boundaries on:
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Autonomy of the system: smart system should be able to decide things in its domain because a lot of information can be used to take decision, doing work for the users. Some limits need not to be overtaken, in order not to threat the hierarchy of society. Machines are tools for human well being
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Distinguishability: according to “red flag law”, system should clearly be recognizable as robot. However for usability the interaction with users should be similar to human-to-human
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Personality: having an artificial intelligence with some personality makes interactions more interesting and seamless for users. A boundary needs to be defined in order to avoid emotional attachment and other inappropriate feelings towards machines. From social point of view, people need to keep their life in real world with real people

    Personalization

  </h2>

   <span>
    “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: compare accuracy of personality judgment done by computers against those made by humans. Using likes to judge five traits: openness, agreeableness, extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Criterions:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Self-other agreement: how much external judger (computer or human) agrees with self-rating
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Interjudge agreement: similarity of rating given by two external judger (human or computer-&gt;training set divided in two parts)
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     External validity: measuring the prediction on life outcomes (facts that can be verified) based on the traits of personality computed (computer) or self-assigned (human)
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Results: computer are more accurate. But there are some differences:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Computer-based judgments can take into account a very big quantity of data and use statistical modeling
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Humans can capture more subtle cues
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <span>
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span>
    “Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: using data of social network profiles (user likes) analyze the prediction rate of non-published personal data -&gt; 10-fold cross-validation
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Results: the majority of informations are accurately predicted. Especially the ethnicity, gender, age. The accuracy increases with the number of likes available, but even with a small data set, the prediction is accurate for some attributes
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Implications of being highly predictive:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Recommendation services can be improved, without explicitly asking some information but inferring them
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Unwilling use of details that user wanted to hide, considered as personal. This implies a decrease in trust of online services

  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: analyze news as social activity
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Results:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     users receive news from friends on social networks, a lot more than directly from news agencies. Friends act like a filter, by sharing news.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     News as a shared social experience is appealing for customers. Main reason for using social networks is sharing content: events, news
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Journalists on social network seem to be important for users
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Using social media for retrieving news is not done at expenses of mainstream media outlets

   <span>
    “Tag-Based User Profiling for Social Media Recommendation”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: use tags to support user profiling. Tags connect entities directly, while collaborative filtering must search for relationships between user preferences and item attribute
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Implementation:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Types of tags (have different weights):
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Personal view: tags specified by the user
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Social view: tags specified by the friends on the user contents
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Tag-to-Tag Matrix: correlations between person-attribute set (tags on user) and content-attribute set (tags on contents)
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     User-feature vector: for each idea mentioned in a specific content, the probability that the user has to like it. If it is above a threshold, it is recommended
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Experiment (using social bookmarking site del.icio.us):
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     A long-tail model applies (URLs are bookmarked by few people). Very low precision (2.77%) because there are not central topics to be defined. Also caused by dependence on order of visit (if user visits a better site before, decision about bookmarking a site on the same topic is lower)

  <p>
   <span>
    “Cross Social Media Recommendation”
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Proposition: merge data from different social networks (Twitter and Weibo) to remove biasing of models based on a single social network. Recommend twitter hashtag to weibo
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Implementation:
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     “Pseudo Global Social Media Network (PGSMN) model to interconnect users (with similar interests, not the same user because the sets are separate) and topics
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Three layers: Twitter, Weibo and Wikipedia. The last one is a bridge. Each layer contains intra-layer links (users to tags or page to category) and inter-layer links (tags to pages/category)
